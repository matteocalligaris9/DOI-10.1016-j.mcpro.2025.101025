## Summary  
Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder with heterogeneous clinical and pathological features, highlighting the need for improved biomarkers to refine diagnosis and patient stratification.  

In this study, we applied a **data-independent acquisition (DIA) proteomics workflow** to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from **138 individuals**, including AD patients with high (AÎ²+/tau+) or normal (AÎ²+/tauâˆ’) CSF tau levels, and non-AD controls.  

Using an **Astral mass spectrometer**, we achieved unprecedented proteome depth, identifying **2,661 proteins** with high data completeness. Comparative proteomic profiling revealed **distinct protein signatures** for AÎ²+/tau+ and AÎ²+/tauâˆ’ subtypes.  

### Key findings  
- Validation in an independent internal cohort and in **external public AD datasets** confirmed robustness and reproducibility.  
- **Machine learning** identified a panel of **15 protein classifiers** that accurately distinguished AD subtypes and controls across datasets.  
- Several proteins were elevated in the **preclinical stage**, underscoring their potential utility for **early diagnosis and stratification**.  

## Conclusion  
Our results demonstrate the power of **Astral DIA proteomics combined with machine learning** to uncover subtype-specific biomarkers of AD, paving the way for **personalized diagnostic strategies**.
